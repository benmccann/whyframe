# Overview

## What is whyframe?

`whyframe` enables rendering any UI framework markup within an `iframe`, including Svelte, Vue, Solid, Preact, and React. Simply:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```html
<iframe data-why>
  Hello world!
</iframe>
```

<HelloWorldDemo />

Without `whyframe`, browsers would only render a blank `iframe`.

## When do I use this?

It's useful if you're:

- Building documentation for a component library that shows isolated usage examples.
- Writing an article that shows static isolated examples.
- Building a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org)/[Histoire](https://histoire.dev) clone.

It cannot be used to:

- Build interactive code examples. It only works in compile-time.
- Create `iframe`s dynamically or using `whyframe` through a CDN. It requires a JavaScript bundler.
- Mix UI frameworks. You can't write React code and inside the iframe, write Svelte code.

## How does it work?

`whyframe` relies on JavaScript bundlers to apply HTML extraction within the `iframe`s. Check out [How it works](/docs/how-it-works) for an in-depth explanation!

## Project status

- Works well for Vite, Svelte, and Vue
- Improvements needed for Webpack, Solid, Preact, React, and Astro
- The API may change during the `v0.x` period
- A [1.0 Roadmap](https://github.com/bluwy/whyframe/discussions/1) has been set out
- The author ([bluwy](https://github.com/bluwy)) is currently working on other projects and has not put much time working on this, but contributions or maintainers are always welcome!

## Requirements

- ESM project. The library is exported as ESM only.
- Node.js 16.

## Quick start

## Manual setup

`whyframe` requires a JavaScript bundler to work. Currently, only Vite is supported, which powers major meta-frameworks such as SvelteKit, Astro, VitePress, and Nuxt.
