# @whyframe/astro

<AstroDemo />

## Status

Experimental. As there isn't a way to render Astro code dynamically, we rely on `data-why="<framework>"` attributes to pass the `iframe` content as framework code. However, since this is not a 1-to-1 conversion, features like:

- `<style>` is not supported in JSX
- `<script>` is not support in all frameworks

Ultimately this integration would only render Astro code, and the framework feature would be removed.

`@whyframe/astro` exports a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) plugin with the options below:

## Options

### include

- **Type:** `string | RegExp | (string | RegExp)[]`
- **Default:** `/\.astro$/`

A [picomatch pattern](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch), or array of patterns, which specifies the files the plugin should operate on.

### exclude

- **Type:** `string | RegExp | (string | RegExp)[]`

A [picomatch pattern](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch), or array of patterns, which specifies the files to be ignored by the plugin.

### defaultFramework

- **Type:** `'svelte' | 'vue' | 'solid' | 'preact' | 'react'`

All `iframe`s require a value for `data-why` to render the HTML content using a specific UI framework. If unset, it can fallback to this value.
